# Stephen's Tech Blog

## Description

A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.

This is my first full stack web application built from scratch. It was a great exercise that helped me see the big picture and really understand the MVC model. It was a struggle at times differentiating between front end APIs and the back end APIs and the various variables at play in each, but the MVC model helped me keep them straight.
